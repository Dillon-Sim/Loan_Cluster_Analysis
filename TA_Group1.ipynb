        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is a machine learning paradigm that encompasses the interaction between human and large language models (LLMs) to generate desired content; where a prompt is a set of instructions given to LLMs that customises, enhances, and refines the LLMs' capabilities (Liu et al., 2023). The fundamental goal of prompt engineering is to enhance the performance and usability of LLMs (Learn-Prompting, 2023, Shin et al., 2020), which are trained on massive amounts of text data and can generate human-like text and complete other language-related tasks with high accuracy (Kasneci et al., 2023). Users can fine-tune their inputs to obtain an applicable output through prompting, which frequently includes task descriptions to direct a particular model further. \n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, a prompt can influence an LLM conversation by offering a set of initial rules and guidelines. These rules can impact the subsequent interactions with the LLM and the output generated from it. Furthermore, providing context for a conversation is crucial as it guides the LLM on what data should be prioritised and how the outcome should be presented (White et al., 2023). Prompt engineering can involve tuning the weights of the model's parameters, fine-tuning the model on specific data, or designing new architectures and training methods that are optimised for specific tasks or domains. Additionally, prompts can adapt to the conversation and suggest additional prompts to gather more data or produce related artefacts, making the programming process more efficient. Their enhanced capabilities are demonstrated by designing prompts to offer value beyond just text or code production (White et al., 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "Prompt engineering is essential in the future since it has the potential to revolutionise the way we interact with language models. By crafting effective prompts, we can utilise the full potential of program language models to perform complex tasks and generate high-quality outputs that meet specific needs (Ekin, 2023). Moreover, as more people rely on language models for various applications, proper prompt engineering is essential to ensure that language models generate accurate, relevant, and unbiased outputs.\n"

        "In general, there are several ways to compose queries for AI language models (Shieh, 2023, OpenAI, 2023):\n",
        "\n",
        "1.\tUse separator or placeholder to separate the instruction and context:\n",
        "\n",
        ">For example: \"#\" for instruction; \n",
        "\"{text input here}\" for actual context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Use specific, descriptive and domain-specific prompts:\n",
        "\n",
        ">Use prompts that specifies what to achieve instead of a generic prompt to get responses that are more relevant and accurate. For instance, \"Add more detail about my experience as a Risk Analyst in the banking industry to my cover letter.\" rather than \"Modify my cover letter.\" \n",
        "\n",
        "3. Use multiple prompts:  \n",
        "\n",
        ">Instead of relying on a single prompt, use multiple prompts that cover different aspects of the task, helping the model generate more diverse and relevant responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Provide examples:  \n",
        "\n",
        ">Normally prompt engineering starts with zero-shot learning, which could produce proper output without being given any examples. In order to improve the performance of the generated content, few-shot prompting (given examples) is a technique to help the LLMs to articulate the output (Wei et al., 2021, Short and Short, 2023). \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the different ways of phrasing prompts, research has demonstrated that with fine-tuning prompts, ChatGPT could generate the desired output (Short and Short, 2023). In addition, Lo (2023) suggested a CLEAR Framework for generating prompts in order to develop an AI-generated content in an effective way: \n",
        "\n",
        "- Concise: be precise and avoid superfluous information \n",
        "\n",
        "- Logical: the prompt should be structured and coherent, following the logical flow \n",
        "\n",
        "- Explicit: set prompts that regards to the output specifications, including the format, content, or scope \n",
        "\n",
        "- Adaptive: attempting different prompt formulations and temperature settings based on the output performance \n",
        "\n",
        "- Reflective: evaluate the output, and refine the future prompts with the insights from the evaluation \n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, the output of prompt engineering will also be affected by LLM settings, for instance, temperature, and top-p parameters (Lo, 2023). The temperature and top-p settings both control the randomness of the responses. The higher the temperature setting leads to the more diverse and creative generated content, whereas the lower temperature produces the factual and deterministic output. As for top-p, it sets the cut-off probability, forcing the model only generate tokens if the probability of being the next token is higher than the given probability threshold, reducing the tendency of composing unexpected content. \n",
